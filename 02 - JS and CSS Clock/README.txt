 we are going to apply a rotate to each of the hands depending on what time it is 
 if we apply a transform rotate to the hands, by default it rotates directly at the center, but thats not what we want. we want the hand to rotate on the edge outwards. 


 by setting transform-origin to 100%, we set the hands to pivot around the circle, exactly like a clock.
